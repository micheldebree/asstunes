# Tunes made in Turbo Assembler on a Commodore 64

This is a digital archeology project to save old tunes made by me and my friends in assembler code on the Commodore 64.
The source is a big box containing all my Commodore 64 floppy disks. These floppy disks were kindly converted by the dedicated conversion team at the [X2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_(demoparty)) demoparty, to disk images (.d64 files). 

The Turbo Assembler source files were then converted to [KickAssembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler) format.

Music: Michel de Bree &amp; Marvin Severijns

Player code: Thomas E. Petersen, Charles Deenen, Falco Paul

# Build

A ```makefile``` is included. It works on my MacBook with Java 8 installed. It builds c64 executables (```.prg```) and mp3 previews for all source files.
